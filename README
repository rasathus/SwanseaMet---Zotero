== Summary ==
Zotero is a great reference management system, and a great open source Endnote alternative. Zotero supports a wide range of word processing applications on most major platforms. For more information, and to download visit Zotero.org

Whilst attending the university, I wrote a CSL style for Zotero, to comply with the Swansea Metropolitan University referencing standards. Version 1.1 is intended for use with the official release version

Version 1.4 was intended for use with the development XPI, although by now I imagine these mappings have made their way into the trunk. This version adds support for referencing conference papers, emails and podcasts.
